##WORKFLOW 
#####All of us will have direct commit access to Cecile's repository as project contributors. But remember:
1. NEVER work on branch master! Master is perfection, and is representative of our latest progress!
2. Do not push or pull from github with uncommitted changes on your local machine. This will cause conflicts.
3. Always pull before you push!
4. Solve all merge conflicts on your own machine. We're all responsible for our individual commits.
5. Work on Branches! We can have shared branches on the main repo if more than one of us needs to work on any given feature at the same time.
6. This is a big project, prepare to do a lot of googling and asking the TA's for help.
7. Check GitHub and Slack daily for team updates! 5 minutes of looking can save you from spending 5 hours working on a feature someone else has already built.
8. Communicate! Communication is key.
#####Here's a quick list of the most common GitHub commands you'll be using:
1. git pull 	(detailed: git pull sourceName branchName)
2. git status 	(Check this before pushing and pulling)
3. git add -A 	(Stage all files for commit. You can also specify individual files)
4. git commit -m 	(commit early, commit often)
5. git push sourceName branchName (specify your endpoints so you don't accidentally push to the wrong branch)
6. git remote -v 	(view remote connections)
7. git checkout -b branchName 	(create branch named branchName and switches to it)
8. git checkout branchName 	(switch from current branch to branchName)
9. git branch 		(view branches)
10. git merge branchName 	(merge branchName INTO current branch)
